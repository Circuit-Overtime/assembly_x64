# Contributing to MIPS Code Repository

ðŸŽ‰ Thank you for considering contributing to this repository! We welcome contributions to various MIPS topics as part of Hacktoberfest. Below are the guidelines to help you get started.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository**
   - Click the 'Fork' button at the top right of this page to fork the repository.

2. **Clone your fork**
   - Clone your fork locally:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Circuit-Overtime/assembly_x64.git
     cd assembly_x64
     ```

3. **Create a new branch**
   - Always create a new branch for your work:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b your-branch-name
     ```

4. **Make your changes**
   - Add your MIPS code for a specific topic under the relevant folder.
   - Ensure your code is well-documented with inline comments explaining its logic.
   - Add a new file for each topic in a consistent naming format:
     ```plaintext
     topic_name.asm
     ```
     For example:
     ```plaintext
     sorting_algorithm.asm
     ```

5. **Test your code**
   - Make sure to test your code using a MIPS simulator (such as [MARS](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/) or [SPIM](https://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/)) to ensure it's working correctly.

6. **Add your contribution to the README (Optional)**
   - If you want, you can also add a short description of your code to the main `README.md`.

7. **Commit your changes**
   - Commit your changes with a meaningful message:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Added MIPS code for topic_name"
     ```

8. **Push to your fork**
   - Push your changes to your forked repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin your-branch-name
     ```

9. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Open a Pull Request from your branch to the `main` branch of the original repository:
     - Go to the 'Pull Requests' tab on the original repository.
     - Click 'New Pull Request' and select your branch.
     - Provide a description of your changes.
   - Make sure to link your pull request to an existing issue if applicable, or create a new issue.

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Code Quality**: Ensure that your code follows clean and efficient programming practices.
- **Documentation**: Add comments in your code explaining the logic. You can also add details to the `README.md` for more complex topics.
- **Topics**: Only contribute MIPS code that fits the scope of the repository (e.g., algorithms, data structures, system calls).
- **Duplicate Contributions**: Before submitting, check if a similar solution already exists. If it does, consider improving it rather than submitting a duplicate.

## Hacktoberfest Participation

If you're contributing for Hacktoberfest, make sure:
- Your pull requests are substantial (not just fixing typos or simple formatting issues).
- They are labeled as `hacktoberfest-accepted` once reviewed.
- You follow the official [Hacktoberfest guidelines](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/).

## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.
